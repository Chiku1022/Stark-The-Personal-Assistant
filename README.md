This is a personal assistant made by me using Python 3 via PyQt5 framework. It can perform a lot of things. You can give it voice commands as well as written commands. A lot more features are present in it. Read further to get a complete overview of it.

> **Important Note**	
> Please read the *requirements.txt* file for installing the pre-requisites for running this project. Without these measures, the code will not work and will eventually break!
